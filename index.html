                underprivileged children at the
                ADW Middle School situated in Melakkottaiyur. VITeach had its first official school visit on 31st
                August 2013.
                Seventeen club members visited the government-run school for the first ice-breaking session held that
                day. Since then,
                VITeach has been teaching English for students of grades 1 – 8 on a daily basis. At present, the
                students are taught
                English and Mathematics by a group of VITeachers visiting the school on every working day.

                delivery system
                more efficient. The algorithm was implemented into their daily schedule and ensured timely delivery of

            <p class="desc">The book drive initiative was held during VIT Chennai’s cultural festival, Vibrance.
                Provisions were made at the
                portico for students and faculties to donate books for setting up a library at ADW Middle School. A
                vendor selling
                children’s books at Rs. 50/- each was identified and given a space on the college grounds, where
                students could buy
                books and donate the same. The Wish Tree was a parallel initiative that intended to fulfil a few little
                wishes of our
                kids at the ADW Middle School, in the form of material needs like pencils, colours, and the like. A
                total of 352
                children’s books and 92 engineering books worth an approximate amount of Rs. 65,000/- were collected
                from the
                initiative. The engineering books collected will be exchanged for children’s books, and the books will
                be used to set
                up a library at the ADW Middle School.</p>
